This is the router, default router includes the necesary files to Syderal works. To import other css files, you need to include it in /assets/folder or /assets/file

If the files arenÂ´t CSS files, you dont need to import them in a router, only use them in the file what you want

If the file is a CSS, you need to import in the router css file to use it.

@import "assets/folder/anawesomefile.css";
@import "assets/anawesomefile.css";
